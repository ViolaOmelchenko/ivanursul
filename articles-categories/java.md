Over the past few years I realized that I spend less and less time writing code in Java and more time doing non-technical things like reading emails(sometimes it can take a lot of time for me). 
I decided to create a separate place in my blog, where Java world will be covered, so I will start with covering basic things and will continue with more sophisticated, edge-cased articles about the Java world.

### Collections

Collections in Java is a framework that gives an API for working with a group of objects.
You perform different kinds of operations like searching, sorting, insertion, removing. Some collections are good for one operations, while other collections are good for other operations.
